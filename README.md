# MOS Skeleton
[![CMake](https://github.com/morganbengtsson/mos-skeleton/actions/workflows/cmake.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/morganbengtsson/mos-skeleton/actions/workflows/cmake.yml)

Example project for the [MOS library](https://github.com/morganbengtsson/mos). Provides a minimal setup, for getting a
window with some graphics and sound up and running.

# Source code

To get the full source code, including submodules:

```git
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/morganbengtsson/mos-skeleton
```
# Building

To build and run the project on Linux. Make a build directory, run cmake and then make:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./mos-skeleton
```

On Windows with Visual studio 2019 and later, with CMake support: 
Simply open the cloned directory, and the build should be configured automatically.

On older Visual studio versions, CMake might have to be invoked manually:

```
cmake ..
```

An appropriate Visual studio solution should then be generated.
